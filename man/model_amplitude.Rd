}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{Numeric} matrix or \code{eseis} object, seismic signals
to work with. Since the function will calculate the maxima of the data it
is usually the envolopes of the data that should be used here. In an 
extreme case, a vector with just the maximum amplitudes recorded at each 
station can be provided, as well.}

\item{model}{\code{Character} value, model to fit the data. One out of the 
list in the details section. Default is \code{"SurfSpreadAtten"}.}

\item{distance}{\code{Numeric} vector with distance of station locations
to source. Alternatively, the distance can be calculated by providing the 
source coordinates (\code{xy}) and distance maps (\code{d_map})}

\item{source}{\code{Numeric} vector of length two, location of the seismic 
source to model (x and y coordinates).}

\item{d_map}{\code{List} object, distance maps for each station (i.e.,
\code{SpatialGridDataFrame} objects). Output of \code{distance_map}.}

\item{coupling}{\code{Numeric} vector, coupling efficiency factors for each
seismic station. The best coupled station (or the one with the highest
amplification) must receive \code{1}, the others must be scaled relatively
to this one.}

\item{v}{\code{Numeric} value, mean velocity of seismic waves (m/s). 
Only relevant for models accounting for unelastic attenuation (see 
details).}

\item{q}{\code{Numeric} value, quality factor of the ground.
Only relevant for models accounting for unelastic attenuation (see 
details).}

\item{f}{\code{Numeric} value, frequency for which to model the
attenuation. Only relevant for models accounting for unelastic attenuation 
(see details).}

\item{k}{\code{Numeric} value, fraction of surface wave contribution to 
signals. Only relevant for models that include mixture of surface and 
body waves (see details).}

\item{a_0}{\code{Logical} value, start parameter of the source amplitude,
if not provided, a best guess is made as 100 times the maximum amplitude
value of the data set.}
}
\value{
\code{List} with model results, including \code{a_0} (source 
amplitude), \code{residuals} (model residuals), \code{coefficients} 
model coefficients.
}
\description{
The function fits one of several models of signal amplitude attenuation and
returns a set of model parameters, including the source amplitude (a_0).
}
\details{
Depending on the choice of the model to fit, several parameters can 
(or should) be provided, e.g. \code{f},\code{q}, \code{v}, \code{k}, 
and most importantly, \code{a_0}. 
If more signals than free parameters are available, the missing 
parameters may be estimated during the fit, but without any checks 
of quality and meaningfulness. The parameter \code{a_0} will be 
defined as 100 times the maximum input amplitude, by default. The 
parameters \code{f} will be set to 10 Hz, \code{q} to 50, \code{v} 
to 1000 m/s and \code{k} to 0.5.

ISSUES: account for non-fixed parameters, especially k

  spreading and unelastic attenuation

  spreading and unelastic attenuation
  \item \code{"SurfBodySpreadAtten"}, Surface and body waves including  
  geometric spreading and unelastic attenuation
  \item \code{"SurfSpread"}, Surface waves including geometric 
  spreading, only
  \item \code{"BodySpread"}, Body waves including geometric 
  spreading, only
  \item \code{"SurfBodySpread"}, Surface and body waves including  
  geometric spreading, only
}

**SurfSpreadAtten**
The model is based on Eq. 17 from Burtin et al. (2016):

\deqn{a_d = a_0 / sqrt(d) * exp(-(pi * f * d) / (q * v))}

where a_0 is the source amplitude, a_d the amplitude as recorded by a sensor 
at distance d, f is the center frequency of the signal, q the ground quality 
factor and v the seismic wave velocity.

**BodySpreadAtten**
The model is based on Eq. 16 from Burtin et al. (2016):

\deqn{a_d = a_0 / d * exp(-(pi * f * d) / (q * v))}

where a_0 is the source amplitude, a_d the amplitude as recorded by a sensor 
at distance d, f is the center frequency of the signal, q the ground quality 
factor and v the seismic wave velocity.

**SurfBodySpreadAtten**
The model based on Eqs. 16 and 17 from Burtin et al. (2016):

\deqn{a_d = k * a_0 / sqrt(d) * exp(-(pi * f * d) / (q * v)) + (1 - k) * a_0 / d * exp(-(pi * f * d) / (q * v))}

where a_0 is the source amplitude, a_d the amplitude as recorded by a sensor 
at distance d, f is the center frequency of the signal, q the ground quality 
factor, v the seismic wave velocity, and n and m two factors determining the 
relative contributions of the two wave types, thus summing to 1.

**BodySpread**
The model is simply accounting for geometric spreading

\deqn{a_d = a_0 / d}

where a_0 is the source amplitude, a_d the amplitude as recorded by a sensor 
at distance d.

**SurfSpread**
The model is simply accounting for geometric spreading

\deqn{a_d = a_0 / sqrt(d)}

where a_0 is the source amplitude, a_d the amplitude as recorded by a sensor 
at distance d.

**SurfBodySpread**
The model is simply accounting for geometric spreading

\deqn{a_d = k * (a_0 / d) + (1 - k) * a_d / sqrt(d)}

where a_0 is the source amplitude, a_d the amplitude as recorded by a sensor 
at distance d, and n and m two factors determining the relative 
contributions of the two wave types, thus summing to 1.
